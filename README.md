# react-booksExample

**Deployed Application**

The live application can be viewed on Heroku: https://boiling-gorge-91801.herokuapp.com/

**Functionality**

The React mounting life-cycle is used to query and display articles based on user searches as well as Node, Express, and MongoDB so that the users can save books to read later.

This is a single page application that uses the react-router-dom to navigate, hide, and show the React components without changing the route within Express.
